# LivePDF RAG: Real-time AI for Dynamic PDF Updates

## Introduction

LivePDF RAG is a production-ready Real-time Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to handle live updates of PDF data for use in generative AI models. It leverages the power of **Pathway**, a real-time RAG framework, and is containerized using **Docker** to ensure seamless deployment across environments. The application ingests PDFs stored in a local **data** folder, adapting instantly to changes in the files. You can also connect the app to a shared **Google Drive**, enabling live collaboration and updates when files are edited.

This setup makes it easy to build and manage live AI-powered applications that require continuous, real-time updates from changing data sources, all while being production-ready and scalable.

## What Problem It Solves

This application solves the problem of handling live, real-time updates to PDF files for use in AI projects. It allows users to store their PDFs in a local folder or connect a **Google Drive** to automatically sync files. This is especially useful for AI projects that require always-updated information, such as collaborative documents or shared research, ensuring that any changes are instantly reflected in the application without needing manual updates.

By supporting a wide range of data sources (including **Google Drive** and over 300 other options), LivePDF RAG simplifies real-time document management and AI generation.

## Architecture Overview

- **Pathway**: The primary framework that powers this RAG system, allowing real-time data ingestion and live updates. It ensures that changes in PDF files are reflected in the AI model in real-time.
  
- **Docker**: Used for containerization, making the app easy to deploy, manage, and scale in production environments. It ensures consistent behavior across different platforms.

- **Local Data Folder**: Stores PDFs locally, which are used as the main data source. The system adapts when new PDFs are added or updated, providing real-time updates to the AI application.

- **Google Drive Integration**: Connect the app to a Google Drive for seamless syncing of collaborative documents. The system detects changes in real time when collaborators modify files in the shared drive.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Install **Docker** on your machine.
- Install **Pathway** using pip:
  
  ```bash
  pip install pathway-ai
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/livepdf-rag.git
    cd livepdf-rag
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t livepdf-rag .
    ```

3. Run the Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 livepdf-rag
    ```

4. Add PDF files to the `data` folder in your project. The system will automatically detect new files or updates to existing ones.

5. (Optional) To connect a Google Drive for live updates, follow the instructions in the **Google Drive Integration** section of this repository (Link to your integration guide or script).
